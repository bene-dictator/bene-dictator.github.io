            <p>I wrote this one nearly half a year ago, I think in June, when I was going through my first bout of separation. I had just moved into my new flat and that was going well, in fact far better than I had expected, but things outside of that I was beginning to lose my grip on (mostly because I am a very jealous person, I think my poetry can reflect that a bit). That period began my first frenzied pieces of poetry writing, when I was trying to understand what I had been getting myself into.</p>
            <p>This one is also in free verse, like my last one. I think the subject of this one came to my head when I was walking home late one night from a Tuesday quiz at the Foundry and I was making my way through Homestead Lane. The walk reminded me of a similar night I experienced when I was (*sigh*) in Italy that disastrous year of 2022, when fog, two horrendous navigation mistakes, and a faulty tollbooth turned what was supposed to be a forty minute drive into a two-and-a-half hour one, all in the midst of an Italian winter. I remember distinctly the fear in the car as we knowingly went down the wrong highway for an hour, my stepfather keeping the window open so he could stay awake as the Italians mercilessly tailgated us with unimaginable spite. Even the traffic lights stopped working in that thick fog, flashing amber weakly as if they had also given up as much as the automated tollbooth had when we finally got off that blighted highway only for us to spend ten long and shivering minutes shouting obscenities at it. Truly a night from the most trivial of hells.</p>
