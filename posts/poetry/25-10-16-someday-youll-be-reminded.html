            <p>Until only recently I thought my emotionality was a burden, something that got the better of me, and that people who could live without needing to worry about others knew a much simpler and ordered world in which they were always in control.</p>
            <p>But now I know I prefer the world where my feelings, strange and unscrutable as they are, connect me to everything and everyone around me- as opposed to the world where my thoughts are determined by a set of instructions, and where my possibilities are blinded and muted by a veil of warmth that hides a unknowable being underneath.</p>
