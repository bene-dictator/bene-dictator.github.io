            <p>As I say so in the first poem I posted here, driving places is one of the ways I forget about the things going on with me. This photo was taken in the early morning of 20 September in Banks Peninsula, at that intersection with the Akaroa road. For some reason I was quite mesmerised by that lone lamppost and really wanted to express something about it.</p>
