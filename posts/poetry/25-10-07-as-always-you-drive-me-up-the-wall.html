            <p>I'm still recovering from yesterday, but I promise you, I can still appreciate things. Like the gale that cools me down as I bike around the Avon, the sun that breaks through the sky on the spring days, the birdsong in the trees...</p>
            <p>A week ago I got my bike fixed again, the second time in as many weeks, and the first thing I did was cycle up Dyers Pass. I tell you, the way down is a genuine substitute for the Queenstown luge. Just be careful you don't go too fast.</p>
            <p>One day I was reading a Poetry Foundation article on an Afghan form of poetry called Landays. That sort of guerilla poetry seemed quite beautiful to me. It was expression against all odds, the sort of concept that was backed up by war and love and faith and a million other things I don't experience for better or for worse. This isn't really a Landay for those reasons, but it's a couplet with 9 syllables in the first line and 13 in the second, so it follows at least the structure of one.</p>
