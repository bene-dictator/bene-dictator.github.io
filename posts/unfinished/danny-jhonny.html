            <p>
                I had my first job when I was barely 18, working for my stepfather at his yard in Sydenham, by that bridge that goes over the train tracks on Colombo St. It was there I began familiarising myself with the little blue truck that I still drive today, one and a half years later. Most mornings my stepfather would drive me to work in his Merc, and the blue Hilux would be sitting behind the roller door by the containers. (Other times, we'd take the Hilux home so I could practice driving around the red zone.) In the yard I was able to drive around as I wished, and I learnt the ins and outs of that car; how the clutch felt, when the engine got loud enough to shift gears (for it had, and still has, no tachyometer), and also just how unluxurious a bench seat 98' Hilux was.

                My stepfather had two Filipinos working at the site. The first one, Danny, was an old fella who was a little foolhardy and exhibited that typical joviality that I now associate with Filipinos - which there are many in Christchurch, always on the construction sites, wearing their sunglasses and balaclavas under their hard hats. I never saw Danny frown, and he always took to work quite readily despite my father's demands. Perhaps it was the fact that he would greet Danny every morning by singing "Oh Danny Boy", and the general rapport that the whole yard seemed to have despite the difficulties. The only mistake I made with Danny was in being too generous, for I was once taught to return a borrowed car with a full tank of gas as a sign of appreciation, and ended up billing $150 to the company when I needed to use his car to get to uni as they needed the Hilux for the day. (My father was understandably unhappy at the unanticipated expenditure, and I never borrowed his car again, for he became quite excitable whenever I happened to need a ride.)

                The other one was Jhonny, a younger man and a carpenter by trade but in the meantime he was working for my father. He was perhaps slightly more steadfast than Danny in a way - or at least a fair bit less clumsy - but undeniably a little quicker, sensible.
